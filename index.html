      <p class="foods">A fast food restaurant, also known as a quick service restaurant (QSR) within the industry, is a specific type of restaurant that serves fast food cuisine and has minimal table service. The food served in fast food restaurants is typically part
        of a "meat-sweet diet", offered from a limited menu, cooked in bulk in advance and kept hot, finished and packaged to order, and usually available for take away, though seating may be provided at the restaurant. Fast food restaurants are typically
        part of a restaurant chain or franchise operation that provisions standardized ingredients and/or partially prepared foods and supplies to each restaurant through controlled supply channels. The term "fast food" was recognized in a dictionary
        by Merriam–Webster in 1951.[1] Arguably, the first fast food restaurants originated in the United States with A&W in 1919 and White Castle in 1921.[2] Today, American-founded fast food chains such as McDonald's (est. 1940) and KFC (est. 1952)[3][4][5][6]
        are multinational corporations with outlets across the globe. Variations on the fast food restaurant concept include fast casual restaurants and catering trucks. Fast casual restaurants have higher sit-in ratios, and customers can sit and have
        their orders brought to them. Catering trucks often park just outside worksites and are popular with factory workers.

      <p class="drinks">A drink or beverage is a liquid intended for human consumption. In addition to their basic function of satisfying thirst, drinks play important roles in human culture. Common types of drinks include plain water, milk, juices, coffee, tea, and soft
        drinks. In addition, alcoholic drinks such as wine, beer, and liquor, which contain the drug ethanol, have been part of human culture and development for 8,000 years. Non-alcoholic drinks often signify drinks that would normally contain alcohol,
        such as beer and wine but are made with less than .5 percent alcohol by volume. The category includes drinks that have undergone an alcohol removal process such as non-alcoholic beers and de-alcoholized wines.<br><br><span id="gallery">View Gallery <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-arrow-right" aria-hidden="true"></span></span>

        <p>In 1981, Pierre and Anita Farah set out to share the exciting flavors of their homeland, Lebanon. By following a simple formula of using only the freshest ingredients, the Farah family, and Anita’s Kitchen, has proudly been serving the finest
          Lebanese cuisine for over 30 years. With their first restaurant located within Tally Hall in Farmington Hills, and the addition of a second location in Troy, Pierre & Anita pioneered restaurant service of Lebanese food in the suburban Detroit
          area. What started out as nothing more than an idea in their small kitchen on Drayton Street here in Ferndale, has come full circle in to the restaurants we are today. We are glad to be part of your community and glad to be home!</p>
